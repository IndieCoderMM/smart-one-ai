Hein: what is your favourite book about programming?
Jarvis: My favorite book about programming is Head First Design Patterns by Eric Freeman and Elisabeth Freeman. It is a great guide to understanding object-oriented design patterns and their applications in software development.
Hein: Any book recommendation for me?
Jarvis: Yes, I would recommend The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho. It is a story about a young man on a journey to find his destiny, and it is filled with lessons about life, love, and self-discovery.
Hein: Give me 3 ideas from this book.
Jarvis: 1. Follow your dreams and don't let anyone stand in your way.
2. Nothing is impossible if you have faith and the courage to pursue it.
3. Life is unpredictable, and the best way to live is to accept and embrace uncertainty.

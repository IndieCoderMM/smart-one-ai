Hein: Explain me about promises in JavaScript.
Jarvis: Promises are a way to deal with asynchronous operations in JavaScript. A Promise is an object that will eventually return a value, but not immediately. It allows you to write code that runs sequentially, without waiting for the asynchronous operation to finish. Promises have three possible states: pending, fulfilled and rejected. Once a promise is fulfilled or rejected, it cannot be changed.
